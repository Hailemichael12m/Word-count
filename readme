Assignment number 1
Name: Hailemichael Molla
STUDENT_ID: 20190771

Working on this assignment was an opportunistic challenge. This assignment helped me learn basic c programming. I constrcuted my dfa in the 
first day I started working on the assignment and writing the first skeleton code was also not that difficult. However, searching for corner cases
where my code fails to meet was the real struggle and it took me over a week in an on-off working schedule. My code has changed a lot after the 
first draft because of corner cases. I have recieved help from TAs (TA Ryuhaerang Choi) in the TA help session and others including fellow 
students in the campuswire discussions.
